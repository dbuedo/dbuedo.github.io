# The Three Laws of Robotics:
#
#   1st. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
#   2nd. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
#   3rd. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
